# Voter_Registration

My program serves as a voter registry where you can input yours or others information,
take a questionnaire, see a list of inputted voters by category, and see a heatmap of voters 
by state and party affiliation. My program starts in cpp and now incorporates python for the heatmap.
I believe python is a good choice for this as it has numerous libraries for data analysis that can be used
in conjunction with one another. 

Option "1":
Asks you to inpout your Name, Political Affilitation, City, and State. It then appends these values to a CV file.

Option "2":
Runs you through a series of four questions where your answers are plugged into an alogrithm to suggest a party for you to associate with.

Option "3":
Shows a list of all voter information entered in the program

Option "4":
Creates a heatmao based off of the values in the CSV file


Needed imports are pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for the python script.

All code authored by yours truly.

I would like to further expand on this project by using dictionaries to validate input for option 1, have the list in option 2 read from the CSV file instead of the programs memory, and add graphics so it is more interactive.
